# Typst in-class quiz

This is the [Typst](https://typst.app) version of my
[easy-in-class-quiz](https://github.com/kljensen/easy-in-class-quiz).
Online pre-class quizzes are less useful to me in the age
of LLMs. So, back to paper.

If you find this useful, awesome! You'll want to customize
it for yourself.

- `quiz.pdf` shows the example output
- `quiz.typ` shows the example quiz
- `quiz_template.typ` is the template for the quiz

## Building

Run `typst compile quiz.typ` to build the PDF.
